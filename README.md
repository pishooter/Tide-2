## The Mechanics

To get started, craft a fishing rod. This can be either the regular fishing rod from the base game, or one of the new fishing rods added by Tide.

</p>

Cast your line by holding right-click and releasing, then wait patiently for a fish to arrive. Fish not biting? Try crafting some bait to increase your fishing speed or provide special bonuses.

Tide also adds a simple fishing minigame for each fish you catch. Right click when the bar is inside the colored region to reel in the fish, but be careful not to lose it! Each fish has its own unique movement behavior and strength, so stay alert.

_Some fish are easy to catch, while others aren't..._

## Fishing Rod Customization

You can add hooks, lines, and cosmetic bobbers to any fishing rod using a new block, the **Angling Table**.

A variety of accessories can be created with unique effects. Some of the bonuses include easier catches, extra luck, or even **lava and void fishing**!

(or making your fishing rod look cool, in the case of the bobbers)

</p>

_You can create any combination of hooks, lines, and bobbers at the Angling Table_

## The Journal

Keep track of all the fish you’ve caught via the **fishing journal**, a special book that gets updated every time you catch a fish. You can use it to track your completion progress, biggest catches, fish habitats, and much more.

_Can you catch them all?_

Want to know where you can catch a fish? You can find **fishy notes** in crates that hint at the locations of individual fish.

## Customizability
Many aspects of the mod can be changed to your liking.

**Need to tweak something?**
You might be able to find what you need in the config screen.

**Looking to add a fish or modify existing ones?**
Tide has a versatile **fish data** system, allowing mod or datapack developers to add their own fish to find in the world via JSON files.

In addition to fish, you can also use datapacks to insert custom loot tables or crates to the fishing loot. Need help customizing something? Feel free to ask in the discord server.
